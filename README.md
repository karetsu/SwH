# Haskell for the Working Statistician

I've tasked myself with learning Julia so I can use it in work - its much easier to request than Haskell. To do this I am working through the very good [Statistics with Julia](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/YoniNazarathy/julia-stats/StatisticsWithJulia.pdf) and will be trying to do the tasks in parallel in Haskell so that I don't forget everything I already think I know.

The book is excellent so far and I would recommend buying it once its published. I know I will.
